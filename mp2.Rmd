The first step was narrowing down the information that we needed from each of the two different tables that we wanted to work with. From the contributions table, we needed the transaction type, the candidate ID associated with that particular transaction type, and the total amount of money spent toward each candidate. From the candidates table, we really only need the candidate name associated with it's corresponding candidate ID. Throughout our process, we thought it was important to create new data sets every time we wrangled, instead of replacing an existing data set, in order to be able to easily go back and look at previous information if need be.

```{r}
transaction_info <- contributions %>%
  group_by(transaction_type, cand_id) %>%
  summarise(transaction_total = sum(transaction_amt))
```

```{r}
candidates_info <- candidates %>%
  group_by(cand_id, cand_name)

candidates_info <- candidates_info[,c("cand_id", "cand_name")]
```

The next step was joining both of the tables together. This way we could have the candidate name, not just the ID, how much money was spent toward each candidate, and transaction type of the money spent all in the same table. Because both of our new data sets had a "cand_id" variable, it was easy to join the two together.

```{r}
transaction_and_candidate <- transaction_info %>%
  inner_join(candidates_info, by = c("cand_id"))
```

We wanted to graph only a couple of candidates. We based our decision off of the top candidates that had the highest amount of money spent toward them. 

```{r}
most_expensive_pres_candidates <- transaction_and_candidate %>%
  group_by(cand_name, cand_id) %>%
  summarise(contribution_total = sum(transaction_total))
```

When Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were the highest and second highest candidate on our list, we decided to only focus on them. We thought this would be an interesting comparison, since they ran against each other in the 2012 Presidential Election. We decided to filter the data to include only the information we needed for those two candidates. Again, we created a brand new table in order to not lose the previous table we created. 

```{r}
transaction_and_pres_candidates <- transaction_and_candidate %>%
  filter(cand_id == "P80003338" | cand_id == "P80003353")
```

Because the point of our graph is to show the amount of money spent either supporting or opposing these candidates, we thought it would be cleaner to only have two different legends, instead of graphing the individual different transaction types. We looked up the different transaction types and determined if the objective of each was to either support or oppose a candidate. We found that only two out of the seven types' goals are to oppose a candidate. We realized we needed to create a different column showing this, in order to group these transaction types together in the future.

```{r}
support_pres_candidates <- transaction_and_pres_candidates %>%
  group_by(cand_id, cand_name) %>%
  mutate(support_true = transaction_type  %in% c("24C", "24E", "24F", "24K", "24Z"))
```

After correctly labeling the different transaction types as true (supported candidate) or false (opposed candidate), we then needed the total amounts for transaction types that spent money opposing candidates and a total amount for transaction types that spent money supporting candidates. Since we had previously created a column specifying the objectives of each transaction type, it made it easy to group them together and find the totals for each.

```{r}
support_total_pres_candidates <- support_pres_candidates %>%
  group_by(cand_id, cand_name, support_true) %>%
  summarise(support_total = sum(transaction_total))
```

After we had the candidates and the amount of money spent either supporting or opposing them, we were ready to start graphing. 

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
```

```{r}
ggplot(support_total_pres_candidates, aes(x = cand_name, y = support_total, fill = support_true)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle("Financial Allocations Toward\n2012 Presidential Candidates") +
  scale_x_discrete("Candidates", labels = c("Barack Obama", "Mitt Romney")) + 
  scale_y_continuous("Amount Spent", labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(fill = "Allocation Objective") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1", labels = c("Opposing Candidate", "Supporting Candidate")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20, face = "bold"),
        axis.ticks.length = unit(0.50, "cm"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "white"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = "white"),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 15), 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 13),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 15),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
```

##Financial Allocations Spent By Committees Toward the 2012 Presidential Campaign 
``
``

**Our data graphic shows the amount of money spent by committees supporting or opposing the 2012 Presidential candidates, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.** 

The x-axis displays the two final candidates for the 2012 presidential election; Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.  The y-axis displays the total amount of money spent by committees. The red represents money spent opposing the candidates and the blue indicates money spent supporting the candidates. 

We grouped the committees based on whether the objective of the transaction type was to support or oppose a candidate. 

The transaction type used by committees are as followed:

*Money Spent Opposing or Against a Candidate:* 24A and 24N 

*Money Spent Towards, Supporting, or Advocating for a Candidate:* 24E, 24C, 24F, 24K, and 24Z

By uncovering the intent of the money spent, we are able to look at the amount of money opposing or supporting toward each candidate. Our data graphic shows that roughly $240 million more was spent opposing Barack Obama than was spent opposing Mitt Romney. That's nearly a two and a half times differece. $35 million more was spent in support of Mitt Romney than Barack Obama. This is interesting because it shows the sheer amount of effort spent against Barack Obama.  

Below is an example of what the money spent against Barack Obama went toward. It's an ad that ran during the 2012 election cycle that was paid for by the committee Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies. This committee's number one transaction type is 24A, which was one of the two types that's intentions are to oppose a candidate. 

![Ad against Obama, provided by ProPubica.org](https://assets.propublica.org/legacy/images/_threeTwo800w/gps_tv_ad_390x260_120813.jpg "Anti-Obama Ad")

Restore Our Future, American Crossroads, Americans for Prosperity, and Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies are all Republican affiliated committees. They make up five of the top 17 financial allocators toward Obama. These committed spent money to negatively impact Obama's image to the public. Money spent supporting Obama isn't seen until The Democratic National Committee enters spot 18 on the top contribution list.

Alternately, The Republican National Committee, Restore our Future, and Republican National Committee make up the top three committee contributions to Mitt Romney. These are all allocating money to support Mitt Romney. It isn't until his 5th top committee allocation that money is spent opposing him. 

We chose to show the financial allocation objectives toward each candidate in our data graphic so that the amount of money spent for or against a candidate can be clear. Since Obama ultimately became the president, we think this is interesting to see that money spent opposing a candidate does not necessarily correlate to that candidate losing. 

In a generalized sense our analysis shows an overview of how money is spent in elections. Large sums and efforts are made opposing candidates. In a broad sense, this can be applied to any number of candidates for any type of election. Money spent opposing a candidate does not necessarily contribute to the outcome of a elected official, nut yet it remains a popular tactic in American Politics.
